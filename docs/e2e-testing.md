# E2E Testing

Playwright tests run against the full Docker stack using a real Bluesky account. Login uses an AT Protocol **app password** — your main account password is never involved.

## How it works

1. `docker-compose.e2e.yml` builds the client with `VITE_E2E_TESTING=true`, swapping the OAuth login form for a simple handle + app-password form.
2. The server enables `POST /auth/e2e-login` (only when `E2E_TESTING=true`), which creates a session via `com.atproto.server.createSession` on the configured PDS.
3. Playwright logs in once via `e2e/auth.setup.ts`, saves session cookies to `e2e/.auth/user.json`, and all specs reuse that state.
4. Playwright connects to **Caddy on port 8090** (exposed by the e2e overlay), bypassing the Anubis bot-protection WAF.
5. `playwright.config.ts` loads `docker/.env` automatically via dotenv — no manual env sourcing needed.

## Local setup

### 1. Create an app password

In your PDS account settings, create an app password named something like `navyfragen-e2e`. Copy it — you won't see it again.

### 2. Add credentials to `docker/.env`

`docker/.env` is gitignored. Add these lines alongside your existing `OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` / `COOKIE_SECRET`:

```
E2E_PDS_URL=https://bsky.social
E2E_HANDLE=yourhandle.bsky.social
E2E_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
```

### 3. Install Playwright

First time only:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

### 4. Start the e2e stack

```bash
docker compose \
  -f docker/docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker/docker-compose.e2e.yml \
  up --build -d
```

Wait ~30 s for services to stabilise.

### 5. Run the tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Interactive UI (useful for debugging):

```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### 6. Tear down

```bash
docker compose \
  -f docker/docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker/docker-compose.e2e.yml \
  down
```

## GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/E2E.yml` runs on every push/PR. Add two repository secrets at **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `E2E_PDS_URL` | PDS URL for the test account (e.g. `https://bsky.social`) |
| `E2E_HANDLE` | `yourhandle.bsky.social` |
| `E2E_APP_PASSWORD` | App password from Bluesky settings |

`OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` and `COOKIE_SECRET` are generated fresh each run. If `E2E_PDS_URL` is not set as a secret it falls back to `https://bsky.social` — only set it if using a non-bsky.social PDS.

## Security properties

- `E2E_TESTING=true` and `VITE_E2E_TESTING=true` are **never set in production**. The bypass route and login form are absent from all non-e2e builds.
- `E2E_HANDLE` and `E2E_APP_PASSWORD` are never baked into any Docker image or source file — locally they live in gitignored `docker/.env`, in CI they come from repository secrets.
- `e2e/.auth/user.json` (saved session cookies) is gitignored and ephemeral per run.

## Adding new tests

Create `.spec.ts` files in `e2e/`. Start each with:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test.use({ storageState: "e2e/.auth/user.json" });
```

The `setup` project in `playwright.config.ts` runs `auth.setup.ts` first; all other specs inherit the logged-in session.

### Project layout

`playwright.config.ts` defines three projects:

| Project | Viewport | Matches |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `setup` | — | `*.setup.ts` (auth) |
| `chromium` | Desktop Chrome | `*.spec.ts` at the `e2e/` root and under `e2e/web/` |
| `mobile-chromium` | Pixel 7 (412×732) | `*.spec.ts` under `e2e/mobile/` |

Put desktop/web tests in `e2e/web/` and mobile-viewport tests in `e2e/mobile/`. The
mobile project runs the same auth setup, so specs there reuse the saved session too.

Run a single project locally:

```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=mobile-chromium
```

### Side-effect hygiene

The suite runs against a real Bluesky PDS on a shared account. Prefer read-only
assertions. For tests that write data:

- **Send message** (`/profile/:handle` → Send) and **Add example messages** create
  only a local postgres row (no PDS record, no Bluesky post) and are deletable via
  `DELETE /api/messages/:tid`. Clean them up in the test via the API.
- **Reply** (`POST /messages/respond`) creates a **permanent** `app.bsky.feed.post`
  on the PDS with no cleanup path. The inbox reply test exercises the compose UI
  and then backs out with Escape — it never sends.
- **Pin/unpin** and the **posting-preferences** switches are pure client state
  (localStorage) and need no cleanup.
- **Settings** toggles write through to the server — read the initial value, toggle,
  assert, then restore via the API.

#### Cross-file isolation on the shared inbox

`playwright.config.ts` sets `fullyParallel: false`, which serialises tests
*within* a file but still runs different spec files concurrently across workers.
Two specs touch the same `E2E_HANDLE` inbox — `e2e/web/inbox.spec.ts` and
`e2e/web/profile-send-message.spec.ts` — so a row one of them creates can land
while the other is mid-check.

To stay robust against that race:

- **Own what you delete.** The inbox delete test doesn't rely on the inbox being
  empty (an assumption that previously made it `test.skip` itself into a
  silent green run, #289). Instead it seeds a single marker'd message via
  `POST /messages/send` (`seedOwnedMessage`), targets only that card by its
  marker text, asserts only *that* card disappears (not a count delta — also
  racy), and best-effort cleans the marker up via the API in a `finally`
  (`deleteMessagesByText`). A populated inbox is never a reason to skip.
- **Tests that don't care which card they touch** (expand/reply, pin/unpin,
  posting-preferences) still use `ensureExampleMessages` (seed only when empty)
  and `cleanupAllMessages` — they operate on the first card and clean whatever
  they seeded. These never had a skip guard and aren't affected by the race.

### Selectors

There are no `data-testid` attributes in the app (the e2e login panel is the only
exception). Tests use accessible queries: `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`.
Mantine notifications render with `role="alert"` (not `role="status"`), and the
notification's accessible name aggregates its title and description.
